# A Garden of Wisdom

This is a personal collection of impactful quotes from various world religions and philosophies, curated for memorization and reflection.

The idea is inspired by the Baha'i quote: “A kindly tongue is the lodestone of the heart of men.”

## Data Structure

The quotes are stored in `quotes.csv` and follow this structure:

- **id**: A unique number for each quote.
- **quote_text**: The full text of the quote.
- **tradition**: The religious tradition (e.g., Baha'i, Christianity, Islam).
- **source_ref**: The specific reference (e.g., John 3:16, Qur'an 2:45).
- **author**: The attributed speaker.
- **tags**: Lowercase, comma-separated keywords for thematic filtering.

## My Goal

This is a living project. The goal is not to be exhaustive, but to be a clean, simple, and impactful source of personal inspiration.
